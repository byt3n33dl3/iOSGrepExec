iOS Kernel Utilities
====================

Prerequisites
-------------
* Jailbroken Device
* task_for_pid0 kernel patch applied (probably the case if jailbroken)
* some way to compile iOS binaries (I use http://code.google.com/p/ios-toolchain-based-on-clang-for-linux/)
* ldid (http://gitweb.saurik.com/ldid.git), already included in the above toolchain

Tools
-----
kdump - Tool to dump a running iOS kernel to a file
kmap - Tool do visualize the kernel address space

Build
-----
    adapt toolchain-ios.cmake
    cd build
    cmake ../
    make

Beware, chances are the device will panic and reboot.
